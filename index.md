## 🚀 Getting Started
Drone-Thermal helps you extract temperature data from thermal images captured by drones like DJI and FLIR. This application turns thermal camera R-JPEG files into CSV format, which shows temperature data for each pixel. With this tool, you can analyze thermal data, generate heatmaps, and understand your drone images better.
